                        The first generation Octavia was released in November 1996 for the 1997 model year and was built 
                        at the modernised Škoda factory in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic. This generation was made 
                        available in liftback or estate styles.<br>
                        The first generation Octavia had a facelift in 2000 for the 2001 model year, and was still 
                        manufactured and marketed in some markets, even after the second generation was introduced in 2004. 
                        In Germany, and other parts of West Europe, as well as Asia, the first generation model was marketed 
                        as the Octavia Tour, while the newer model is marketed as the Octavia. In some markets, the first 
                        generation Octavia was still known as Octavia, and the newer model was referred to as the new Octavia, 
                        Octavia5 (Greece) or Laura (India).
