                        The third-generation Octavia was revealed on 11 December 2012 at the Škoda Museum 
                        in Mladá Boleslav. The car began to appear in showrooms in key European markets in 
                        February 2013.<br>
                        Previously, photos of the car covered in light camouflage were released to the media 
                        in late October 2012, after other pre-production cars had already been spotted 
                        on several occasions during the same month. It was once again spotted, 
                        this time without camouflage, on 18 November 2012 in Santiago, Chile, in both liftback 
                        and estate body styles, during the filming of a TV advertisement.<br>
                        The third-generation Octavia is the first Škoda car to feature front radar and a 
                        multifunction camera. The radar sensor in the front bumper monitors the area in front 
                        of the vehicle and continually evaluates the distance, direction, and speed of all 
                        nearby objects (not only traffic).<br>
                        The Octavia features numerous so-called ‘Simply Clever‘ details, i.e. an ice scraper 
                        inside the fuel filler flap, a rubbish bin inside the door panel, a parking ticket 
                        holder and a double-sided (rubber/textile) floor mat in the boot. A tilting/sliding 
                        panoramic sunroof is available as an option – a single-piece for the Octavia liftback 
                        and two-piece for the Octavia Combi. The Bolero, Amundsen, and Columbus car radios are 
                        protected against theft by the physical separation of the central display and the multimedia 
                        system's own central unit. The Octavia also offers a Phone Box, a storage compartment for a 
                        mobile phone with a planar antenna at the bottom of the compartment, which permits a so-called 
                        inductive exterior antenna connection.<br>
                        On 10 January 2017 in Vienna, Škoda presented the third-generation Octavia facelift. The main 
                        changes brought mainly split front headlights, a solid centre section between the front grille, 
                        and a new system for predictive pedestrian protection. Plastic (exterior) side door mouldings 
                        were absent on the facelift Scout model. The first cars were delivered to customers before spring. 
                        The Chinese version leaked in March 2017 and a totally different taillight design and similar 
                        to its bigger counterpart, Škoda Superb.
