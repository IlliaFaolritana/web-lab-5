                        The second-generation Octavia was introduced in March 2004, based on the Volkswagen Group A5 
                        (PQ35) platform also used by other Volkswagen Group cars, such as the Audi A3 Mk2, Volkswagen 
                        Golf Mk5, Volkswagen Jetta Mk5, SEAT León Mk2, etc.<br>
                        Responsible for the design were Thomas Ingenlath and Peter Wouda. Along with a new 
                        internal-combustion engine range, also shared with other models of the Volkswagen Group, 
                        body changes included more legroom for rear-seat passengers (a weak point in the original model) 
                        and increased ground clearance at front and rear to reduce the risk of grounding on steep ramps 
                        or facing kerbs.<br>
                        A facelifted version was launched in 2009, after being formally unveiled at the 2008 Paris Motor 
                        Show. The modifications of the facelifted version include aesthetic exterior changes, 
                        mechanical changes, and interior features. Externally, the designs of the headlights and 
                        bumpers were revised. Some changes were made to the range of available engines and manual and 
                        automatic gearboxes, with the 1.4 TSI and 1.8 TSI engines and the seven-speed direct-shift gearbox 
                        transmission available for the first time. Inside the car, the stereo and steering wheels were 
                        revised, along with some of the interior trim.
