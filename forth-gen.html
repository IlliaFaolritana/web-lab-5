                        The fourth-generation Octavia was revealed in Prague on 11 November 2019. 
                        It was scheduled to be delivered to customers starting from June 2020.<br>
                        The fourth generation Octavia features many new technologies. It is the first 
                        Škoda model to use a head-up display. Other new technologies include two 10" 
                        displays, wireless smartphone charging, up to 5 USB-C ports, a new Sound System 
                        by Canton, and the classic shifting stick for the automatic gearbox has been replaced 
                        with a small joystick. New safety features include taking control of steering in 
                        case of a possible accident, checking for oncoming vehicles when opening doors, and 
                        detection of the driver falling asleep or losing consciousness.<br>
                        A facelift for the Octavia Mk4 range was unveiled on 14 February 2024. Changes include 
                        a new grille, updated front and rear bumpers, new headlights (with the option of the 
                        new second-generation matrix LED type) and taillights, new exterior colours, new alloy 
                        wheel designs, the use of sustainable materials for seat upholstery and Simply Clever 
                        features, new colour choices and fabrics for the dashboard, updated graphics for instrument 
                        cluster, updated and added features for multimedia and safety, and increased power output 
                        for the high performance Octavia RS.
